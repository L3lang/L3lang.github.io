# Control Flow

## if

Take an expression that evaluates into an integer as a `condition`.  
If the `condition` evaluates to non-zero value, the `then` branch is executed.  
otherwise the `else` branch is executed.

## while

Take an expression that evaluates into an integer as a `condition`.  
While the `condition` evaluates to non-zero value, the `body` is executed.
