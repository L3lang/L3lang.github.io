# Introduction

Currently L3 is purely computational.  
It does not have concepts like a display method (console, GUI) or an operating system.

L3 compiles into a lower level language.  
Currently C++ is supported.  
Support for more languages, such as Python and JavaScript, is planned in the future.

This tutorial assumes you already know how to program.

L3 uses a graphical code editor to directly edit the [Abstract Syntax Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree).

## Terminology

**expression** - something that returns a value. For example addition operation, function call.  
**statement** - something that defines part of the program. For example function decleration, if statement.
