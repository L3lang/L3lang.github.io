# Control Flow

## if

Take an expression that evaluates into an integer as a `condition`.  
If the `condition` evaluates to non-zero value, the `then` branch is executed.  
otherwise the `else` branch is executed.

### Example:
![](/assets/images/if.png)

In the above example `f()` will return `2`.

## while

Take an expression that evaluates into an integer as a `condition`.  
While the `condition` evaluates to non-zero value, the `body` is executed.

### Example:
[![](/assets/images/while.png)](/assets/images/while.png)

In the above example `f()` will return `10`.
